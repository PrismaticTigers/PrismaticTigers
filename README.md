## Welcome to my profile!
Hello! My name is Kelly. I have a love for writing code, and I'm currently in the process of learning how to use certain languages one by one! So far, I've learned:
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap, Tailwind)
- Javascript
- Nodejs
- Vue
- Svelte (I didn't completely finish learning this, but I might give it another go with SvelteKit!)
- Angular (I also didn't finish learning this...)
- React
- Next
- Nuxt
- SCSS (This is a lifesaver for writing lots of CSS...)
